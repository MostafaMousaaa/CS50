# 🎓 CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

> *"This is CS50!"* - David J. Malan

## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to my CS50 journey! This repository contains comprehensive notes, code examples, and implementations from Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course, taught by the legendary **David J. Malan**.

### 💡 Understanding What's Underneath the Hood

As David always emphasizes, CS50 isn't just about learning to code—it's about **understanding what's happening underneath the hood**. This course teaches us to think computationally and solve problems methodically, building a strong foundation that transcends any single programming language.

## 🎯 Course Philosophy

### David's Key Mantras:
- 🔍 **"Understanding underneath the hood"** - We don't just use tools; we understand how they work
- 🧠 **"Computational thinking"** - Breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces
- 🎨 **"Correctness, Design, Style"** - The three pillars of good programming
- 🌟 **"This is less comfortable → more comfortable"** - Growth happens outside your comfort zone
- 🎪 **"Algorithms in pseudocode"** - Think first, code second
- 🔢 **"Off by one errors"** - Attention to detail matters
- 📊 **"Big O notation"** - Efficiency and scalability are crucial
