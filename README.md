# 🎓 CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

> *"This is CS50!"* - David J. Malan

## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to my CS50 journey! This repository contains comprehensive notes, code examples, and implementations from Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course, taught by the legendary **David J. Malan**.

### 💡 Understanding What's Underneath the Hood

As David always emphasizes, CS50 isn't just about learning to code—it's about **understanding what's happening underneath the hood**. This course teaches us to think computationally and solve problems methodically, building a strong foundation that transcends any single programming language.

## 🎯 Course Philosophy

### David's Key Mantras:
- 🔍 **"Understanding underneath the hood"** - We don't just use tools; we understand how they work
- 🧠 **"Computational thinking"** - Breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces
- 🎨 **"Correctness, Design, Style"** - The three pillars of good programming
- 🌟 **"This is less comfortable → more comfortable"** - Growth happens outside your comfort zone
- 🎪 **"Algorithms in pseudocode"** - Think first, code second
- 🔢 **"Off by one errors"** - Attention to detail matters
- 📊 **"Big O notation"** - Efficiency and scalability are crucial

## 🎓 Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of CS50, students will:

- ✅ **Think computationally** and solve problems methodically
- ✅ **Understand computer science fundamentals** that transcend programming languages
- ✅ **Write correct, well-designed, and stylish code**
- ✅ **Debug effectively** using proper techniques and tools
- ✅ **Implement fundamental algorithms and data structures**
- ✅ **Manage memory** and understand system-level programming
- ✅ **Build web applications** from front-end to back-end


- **forms_app/** — A simple app showing how to handle HTML forms, process user input, and display responses. Great for learning about routing, request methods, and templates.
- **frosh_ims_app/** — A registration system for intramural sports, demonstrating form validation, user feedback, and storing submitted data. This mirrors the classic CS50 “Frosh IMs” example.
- **shows_app/** — An app that queries a SQLite database and displays TV show data using templates. Illustrates database integration and dynamic content rendering.

Each app is self-contained with its own `app.py` and `templates/` folder. To run an app, navigate to its directory and execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

You can then visit the app in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## 🌟 David's Inspirational Quotes

> *"The best way to learn to program is to program."*

> *"Programming is not about what you know; it's about what you can figure out."*

> *"Don't be afraid to break things. That's how you learn."*

> *"In programming, there's often more than one way to solve a problem. Focus on correctness first, then optimize."*

> *"AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not replace human judgment."*

> *"Understanding what's underneath the hood applies to AI too - know how these systems work."*

> *"Databases are just fancy filing cabinets - but the organization makes all the difference."*

> *"SQL injection is like leaving your front door wide open - always sanitize your inputs!"*

> *"The web is just computers talking to each other. HTML provides the nouns, CSS the adjectives, and JavaScript the verbs."*
