# 🎓 CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

> *"This is CS50!"* - David J. Malan

## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to my CS50 journey! This repository contains comprehensive notes, code examples, and implementations from Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course, taught by the legendary **David J. Malan**.

### 💡 Understanding What's Underneath the Hood

As David always emphasizes, CS50 isn't just about learning to code—it's about **understanding what's happening underneath the hood**. This course teaches us to think computationally and solve problems methodically, building a strong foundation that transcends any single programming language.

## 🎯 Course Philosophy

### David's Key Mantras:
- 🔍 **"Understanding underneath the hood"** - We don't just use tools; we understand how they work
- 🧠 **"Computational thinking"** - Breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces
- 🎨 **"Correctness, Design, Style"** - The three pillars of good programming
- 🌟 **"This is less comfortable → more comfortable"** - Growth happens outside your comfort zone
- 🎪 **"Algorithms in pseudocode"** - Think first, code second
- 🔢 **"Off by one errors"** - Attention to detail matters
- 📊 **"Big O notation"** - Efficiency and scalability are crucial

## 📚 Course Structure

### Week 0: Scratch - *Thinking Algorithmically*
- **Binary representation** - How computers really "think"
- **Pseudocode** - Planning before programming
- **Visual programming** with Scratch blocks

### Week 1: C - *Getting Closer to the Machine*
- **Low-level programming** - Understanding memory and pointers
- **Functions and scope** - Building reusable code
- **Data types** - Choosing the right tool for the job

### Week 2: Arrays - *Data Structures Fundamentals*
- **Memory layout** - How data is actually stored
- **Strings as arrays** - Characters under the hood
- **Command-line arguments** - Programs that take input

### Week 3: Algorithms - *Efficiency Matters*
- **Big O notation** - Measuring algorithmic efficiency
- **Searching algorithms** - Linear vs Binary search
- **Sorting algorithms** - Selection, Bubble, and Merge sort
- **Recursion** - Functions calling themselves

### Week 4: Memory - *Manual Memory Management*
- **Pointers** - Direct memory access
- **Dynamic memory allocation** - malloc() and free()
- **Memory leaks** - What happens when you forget to clean up

## 🌟 David's Inspirational Quotes

> *"The best way to learn to program is to program."*

> *"Programming is not about what you know; it's about what you can figure out."*

> *"Don't be afraid to break things. That's how you learn."*

> *"In programming, there's often more than one way to solve a problem. Focus on correctness first, then optimize."*
