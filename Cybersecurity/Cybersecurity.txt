1. Passwords
------------
- Passwords are the most common form of authentication but are often weak or reused, making them vulnerable to attacks.
- Strong passwords are long, random, and unique for each account.
- Common attacks include brute force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.

2. Password Managers
--------------------
- Password managers help users generate, store, and autofill strong, unique passwords for every site.
- They reduce the risk of password reuse and make it easier to maintain good password hygiene.
- Examples include LastPass, 1Password, and Bitwarden.

3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
-----------------------------------
- 2FA adds a second layer of security beyond just a password (e.g., a code sent to your phone or generated by an app).
- Even if a password is compromised, 2FA can prevent unauthorized access.
- Common methods: SMS codes, authenticator apps, hardware tokens.

4. Hashing
----------
- Hashing is a one-way function that converts data (like a password) into a fixed-size string (the hash).
- Hashes are used to store passwords securely; the original password cannot be easily recovered from the hash.
- Good systems use salted hashes to defend against rainbow table attacks.

5. Cryptography
---------------
- Cryptography is the science of securing information through encoding (encryption) and decoding (decryption).
- Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for encryption and decryption; asymmetric uses a public/private key pair.
- Used for secure communication, digital signatures, and more.

6. Passkeys
-----------
- Passkeys are a modern, passwordless authentication method based on public-key cryptography.
- They are resistant to phishing and credential theft, and are being adopted by major platforms.
- Passkeys can be stored on devices and synced securely across platforms.

7. Encryption
-------------
- Encryption transforms readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using a key.
- Only someone with the correct key can decrypt and access the original data.
- Used to protect data at rest (on disk) and in transit (over networks).

8. Deletion
-----------
- Deleting a file does not always remove it from disk; it may just remove the reference.
- Secure deletion involves overwriting data to prevent recovery.
- Tools and best practices exist for securely erasing sensitive information.

9. Ransomware
-------------
- Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment for the decryption key.
- Prevention includes regular backups, software updates, and user education.
- Never pay the ransom; instead, restore from backups and report the incident.
