Lecture 7 - Artificial Intelligence

Introduction to AI:
- Artificial Intelligence: computer systems performing tasks requiring human intelligence
- Current AI revolution driven by machine learning and large language models
- AI applications: image generation, text generation, decision making, pattern recognition

Image Generation:
- AI can create realistic images from text descriptions
- DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion
- Text-to-image models trained on millions of image-text pairs
- Applications: art, design, content creation, prototyping

ChatGPT and Large Language Models:

- Trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet
- Can write code, answer questions, explain concepts, translate languages
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture

Prompt Engineering:
- Art of crafting effective prompts for AI systems
- Clear, specific instructions yield better results
- Context and examples improve AI performance
- Iterative process of refining prompts

CS50.ai:
- AI-powered teaching assistant for CS50
- Helps students with coding questions and concepts
- Demonstrates practical application of AI in education
- Personalized learning assistance

Generative AI:
- AI systems that create new content (text, images, code, audio)
- Based on patterns learned from training data
- Examples: GPT for text, DALL-E for images, GitHub Copilot for code
- Transforming creative industries and workflows

Decision Trees:
- Tree-like model for making decisions
- Internal nodes: decision points (conditions)
- Branches: possible outcomes
- Leaves: final decisions/classifications
- Easy to understand and interpret

Decision Tree Construction:
- Start with root node containing all data
- Choose best attribute to split on
- Create branches for each possible value
- Repeat recursively for each branch
- Stop when pure nodes or stopping criteria met

Information Gain:
- Measure used to select best splitting attribute
- Based on entropy (measure of randomness/impurity)
- Higher information gain = better split
- Entropy = -Î£(p * log2(p)) for all classes

Minimax Algorithm:
- Game-playing algorithm for two-player zero-sum games
- Assumes both players play optimally
- Maximizing player (MAX) tries to maximize score
- Minimizing player (MIN) tries to minimize score
- Evaluates game tree to determine best move

Minimax Process:
1. Generate game tree to desired depth
2. Evaluate leaf nodes with utility function
3. Propagate values up the tree
4. MAX nodes choose maximum child value
5. MIN nodes choose minimum child value
6. Root value determines best move

Alpha-Beta Pruning:
- Optimization technique for minimax
- Eliminates branches that won't affect final decision
- Alpha: best value found for MAX player
- Beta: best value found for MIN player
- Prune when alpha >= beta

Machine Learning:
- Algorithms that improve performance through experience
- Learn patterns from data without explicit programming
- Types: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning

Supervised Learning:
- Learn from labeled training data (input-output pairs)
- Goal: predict outputs for new inputs
- Classification: predict categories/classes
- Regression: predict continuous numerical values

Classification vs Regression:
- Classification: spam/not spam, image recognition, medical diagnosis
- Regression: stock prices, house values, temperature prediction
- Different algorithms and evaluation metrics for each

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):
- Simple classification algorithm
- Classify based on k closest training examples
- "Lazy learning" - no explicit training phase
- Choice of k affects performance (odd numbers avoid ties)

Distance Metrics:
- Euclidean distance: straight-line distance
- Manhattan distance: sum of absolute differences
- Distance determines which neighbors are "closest"
- Feature scaling important for fair comparison

Unsupervised Learning:
- Find patterns in data without labels
- Clustering: group similar data points
- Dimensionality reduction: simplify data representation
- Market segmentation, data compression, anomaly detection

Deep Learning:
- Machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers
- Inspired by biological neural networks
- Automatic feature extraction from raw data
- Revolutionized computer vision, NLP, and many other fields

Neural Networks:
- Networks of interconnected nodes (neurons)
- Each connection has a weight
- Neurons apply activation functions to weighted inputs
- Training adjusts weights to minimize prediction errors

Deep Neural Networks:
- Input layer: receives data
- Hidden layers: extract increasingly complex features
- Output layer: produces final predictions
- More layers = "deeper" network

Training Neural Networks:
- Backpropagation: algorithm for adjusting weights
- Gradient descent: optimization method
- Loss function: measures prediction errors
- Iterative process of forward pass and backward pass

Large Language Models (LLMs):
- Neural networks trained on massive text datasets
- Transformer architecture enables understanding of context
- Billions or trillions of parameters
- Can generate human-like text, translate, summarize, code

How LLMs Work:
- Predict next word based on previous context
- Attention mechanisms focus on relevant parts of input
- Pre-training on general text, fine-tuning for specific tasks
- Emergent capabilities from scale and training

Hallucinations in AI:
- AI generating false or nonsensical information
- Appears confident even when wrong
- Challenge for reliability and trust
- Mitigation: fact-checking, verification, transparency about limitations

AI Ethics and Considerations:
- Bias in training data leads to biased AI
- Privacy concerns with data collection
- Job displacement and economic impacts
- Need for responsible AI development and use

Applications of AI:
